# Contributing Guidelines

## Workflow

1. **Pull the latest main**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/short-description
   ```
   Use `fix/` or `chore/` prefixes where appropriate.

3. **Make your changes, commit using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add login screen"
   git commit -m "fix: correct token refresh bug"
   ```

4. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/short-description
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request into main**:
   - Fill out the PR template.
   - CI (lint, type-check, tests) must pass.
   - A code owner for the folders you touched must approve.
   - Once approved, a code owner/lead merges using **Squash and merge**.

## Rules

- **No direct pushes to `main`** — everything goes through a reviewed PR.
- Keep PRs focused and small where possible.
- **Never commit secrets** — use `.env` files (strictly excluded via `.gitignore`).
- Rotate credentials if a team member leaves.

## Access

See the internal Tools Setup & Team Access Guide for role assignments per tool (GitHub, Vercel, Render, Expo/EAS, Sentry, DB access).
